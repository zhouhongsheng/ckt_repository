 * The goal of this is to provide sane defaults, but be as flexible as possible.
 * Gulp tasks are defined in isomorphic/lib/gulp/*. If they work for you as is, your all set.
 * For more control, overwrite / add new tasks in this file, or by creating /gulp/tasks/*.js.
 * Before doing so, consider submitting a pull request (https://github.com/frontendperformance/isomorphic).
 * Note: if you override a task, you may have to adjust your package.json.
