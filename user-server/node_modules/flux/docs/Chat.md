This is an example application we've created to show an example of how a Flux app is structured, and how you might use `waitFor` to make sure the `Stores`' registered callbacks are called in the correct order.

The entire application is available in the React GitHub repo within the [flux-chat](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat/) example directory.
